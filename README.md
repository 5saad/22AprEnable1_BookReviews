Mockito was used on the service classes so that they could be tested in isolation, ensuring all of the functions work.
MockMvc Was used to test the controller classes to ensure that the correct HTTP responses were being recieved, as well as the correct response content.
Selenium was also used to run automated tests on the front-end of the application, making sure all of the inputs and buttons work and output what is expected.
